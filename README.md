2. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Launch Instance".
   - **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**:
     - Select an AMI that suits your needs (e.g., **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS**).
   - **Select an Instance Type**:
     - Choose an instance type (e.g., `t2.micro` for free tier eligibility).
   - **Configure Instance Details**:
     - Leave most settings as default, but ensure your VPC and subnet settings allow public access.
   - **Add Storage**:

       - **SSH**: Port 22 (for remote access; restrict to your IP if possible)
   - **Review and Launch**:
     - Review your settings and click "Launch". Select or create a new key pair to access your instance securely.
